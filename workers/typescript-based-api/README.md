# TypeScript API demo - Etymologist.ai

This is a quick demo of [Hono](https://hono.dev) serving a TypeScript API that allows for a streaming AI response from the latest [Workers AI Llama 3.1 ](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers-ai/models/llama-3.1-8b-instruct/).

The [client side JavaScript](./public/script.js) shows off how to handle the streaming text.

NOTE: This currently only works when deployed.
